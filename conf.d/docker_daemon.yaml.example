instances:
  - ## Daemon and system configuration
    ##

    # URL of the Docker daemon socket to reach the Docker API. HTTP/HTTPS also works.
    # Warning: if that's a non-local daemon, we won't be able to collect performance metrics.
    #
    url: "unix://var/run/docker.sock"

    ## Data collection
    ##

    # Collect disk usage per container with docker.container.size_rw and
    # docker.container.size_rootfs metrics.
    # Warning: This might take time for Docker daemon to generate,
    # ensure that `docker ps -a -q` run fast before enabling it.
    # Defaults to false.
    #
    # collect_container_size: false

    # Do you use custom cgroups for this particular instance?
    # Note: enabling this option modifies the way in which we inspect the containers and causes
    #       some overhead - if you run a high volume of containers we may timeout. Please only
    #       enable if absolutely necessary.
    # custom_cgroups: false

    # Collect images stats
    # Number of available active images and intermediate images as gauges.
    # Defaults to false.
    #
    # collect_images_stats: false

    # Collect disk usage per image with docker.image.size and docker.image.virtual_size metrics.
    # The check gets this size with the `docker images` command.
    # Requires collect_images_stats to be enabled.
    # Defaults to false.
    #
    # collect_image_size: false

    # Collect disk metrics (total, used, free) through the docker info command for data and metadata.
    # This is useful when these values can't be obtained by the disk check.
    # Example: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html
    # Note that it only works when the storage driver is devicemapper.
    # Explanation of these metrics can be found here:
    # https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/v1.11.1/daemon/graphdriver/devmapper/README.md
    # Defaults to false.
    #
    # collect_disk_stats: true


    # Exclude containers based on their tags
    # An excluded container will be completely ignored. The rule is a regex on the tags.
    #
    # How it works: exclude first.
    # If a tag matches an exclude rule, it won't be included unless it also matches an include rule.
    # Examples:
    # exclude all, except ubuntu and debian.
    # exclude: [".*"]
    # include: ["docker_image:ubuntu", "docker_image:debian"]
    #
    # include all, except ubuntu and debian.
    # exclude: ["docker_image:ubuntu", "docker_image:debian"]
    # include: []
    #
    # Default: include all containers
