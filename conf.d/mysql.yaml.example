    # port: 3306             # Optional
    # sock: /path/to/sock    # Connect via Unix Socket
    # defaults_file: my.cnf  # Alternate configuration mechanism

    #   schema_size_metrics: false
    #   disable_innodb_metrics: false
    #
    #     NOTE: disable_innodb_metrics should only be used by users with older (unsupported) versions of
    #           MySQL who do not run/have innodb engine support and may experiment issue otherwise.
    #           Should this flag be enabled you will only receive a small subset of metrics.
    #
    #     NOTE: extra_performance_metrics will only be reported if `performance_schema` is enabled
    #           in the MySQL instance and if the version for that instance is >= 5.6.0
    #
    #           extra_performance_metrics and schema_size_metrics will run two heavier queries
    #           against your DB to compute the relevant metrics for all your existing schemas.
    #           Due to the nature of these calls, if you have a high number of tables and/or schemas,
    #           you may be subject to some negative impact in the performance of your DB.
    #           Please bear that in mind when enabling them.
    #           Metrics provided by the options:
    #                     - mysql.info.schema.size (per schame)
    #                     - mysql.performance.query_run_time.avg (per schema)
    #                     - mysql.performance.digest_95th_percentile.avg_us
    #
    #           With the addition of new metrics to the MySQL catalog starting with agent >= 2.1.0, because
    #           we query additional schemas to get this full set of metrics. Some of these require the user
    #           defined for the instance to have PROCESS and SELECT privileges. Please take a look at the
    #           MySQL integration documentation in the ServerDensity site for further instructions.
